# Table Saw Bench

## Tools used so far

* Table saw
* Circular saw
* Orbital sander
* Chisels
* Pocket hole jig

## Overview

This is my second project.

I started with 3D modeling it with Fusion 360 ([View & download the model](https://a360.co/2VrNPQE)):

_The bench is going to be about 2' by 30". It actually was **way** bigger when I started to think about it. Refer to [Story](#Story) if you interested. :-)_

Vertical stands most are 2x4, horizontal bars are 2x3.

It is built like this:

## Build

* Cut the wood.

    Since the table saw bench hasn't been built yet, I had to use circular saw for the long ones.

* Rabbet Join (using a table saw)

  1. Set the blade height and then cut the multiple lines like this:

  1. Hammer down the chips. It is not as difficult as it looks like.

  1. Sand away the rough surface overs:

  1. I am pretty satisfied with the final result:

      _I used 40 grits paper with orbital sander and get the work done in a few seconds._

* Bench Top

  * Cut

    Since the bench was not ready for use yet, I cut the table top with a circular saw + a tracking jig.

    The tracking jig really made things simple because I can see where the blade is going to be, and also it will be pretty straight as long as the saw is pushed toward the track.

## Story

When I started to think about the bench, I was trying to make it multi-functional kind of mega table that does everything and I was quite eager to have a huge surface that I could work on. It was 8' x 4', and looked like this:

  <img src='images/TableSawBench-3DModel-Huge.png' width='450' alt='Huge table saw bench' />

I brought the model to a WeChat group (dingsworkshop) and asked for opinions, that's when people start to noticing that the table is huge and it is not easy to move around and it would probably be too heavy and I am suggested to have multiple smaller tables instead. Err... why do I need a huge table? Why not 2 or 3 smaller ones to reach the same goal? It would be much easier to work in a tight space.

After I shrink the size of the table (well, in the 3d model), I think I am way satisfied with the current size than the stupid gigantic one. I am so glad that I brought this to a group of people with experience than just do it. :-)
