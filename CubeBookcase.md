## Overview

This project is in progress. Got [the 3D model](https://a360.co/35g3FB4) drafted. Here's the render:

I plan to use 1/2" sande plywood as the material.

## Start

After I have the build plan above, I went to the store, bought 2 4' by 8' plywood. I ripped them into 4 1' by 8' each and took them home.

At this point, I am expecting a lot of cross cuts. It is probably worth the time to build a crosscut sled:
