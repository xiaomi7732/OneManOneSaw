[Last Update: 5/16/2020]

This project is in progress. Got [the 3D model](https://a360.co/35g3FB4) drafted. Here's the render:

I plan to use 1/2" sande plywood to build it.

## Build Plan

Download [BuildPlan.pdf](./pdfs/CubeBookcaseDrawingv13.pdf).

## Start

After I have the build plan above, I went to the store, bought 2 4' by 8' plywood. I ripped them into 4 1' by 8' each and took them home.

At this point, I am expecting a lot of cross cuts. It is probably worth the time to build a crosscut sled:

After an hour, here's all the boards in their width, 13", 12.5", 12" and 11.5", and a 24" board for the base.

To build the boxes, I start to cut the rabbet like on the plan:

Okay, ready to do some real job:
