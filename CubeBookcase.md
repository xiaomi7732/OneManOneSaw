# Cube Bookcase

## Overview

[Last Update: 6/8/2020]

This project is in done. Got [the 3D model](https://a360.co/35g3FB4) vs the build out:

I used 1/2" sande plywood to build it.

After this is built, I think I would do it with some modification. I updated the plan:

* [BuildPlanV2.pdf](./pdfs/cubeBookcaseRefine-v1.pdf).

## Start

After I have the build plan above, I went to the store, bought 2 4' by 8' plywood. I ripped them into 4 1' by 8' each and took them home.

At this point, I am expecting a lot of cross cuts. It is probably worth the time to build a crosscut sled:

After an hour, here's all the boards in their width, 13", 12.5", 12" and 11.5", and a 24" board for the base.

To build the boxes, I start to cut the rabbet like on the plan:

Okay, ready to do some real job:

And here's the base, simply guy 3 pieces of plywood together:

Then, I start to build up the stack of cases. They have been separated to layers, each layer looks like this except the top layer, and I built 3 of these:

Basically, the vertical boards in middle of the cases are 13" in length. They are glued together with 1" up-down to form the insert at the top and the bottom.

On top of each case, I use board in length of 11.5" and 12" interactively to form a groove for the insert above this layer.

And the top layer is even more simple:

The build out looked like this - only without paint:

It has shorter vertical boards in the middle, and it doesn't need to form another groove for anything on the top.

## Paint

Paint on plywood edges requires a little bit preparation since they are rough. I fill the edges with spacklings and let it dry. Then, I give it a light sand.

Then, I applied one round of white prime and 2 rounds of the white paint, with mostly a small roller.

The trick without a sprayer is: paint each layer thin.

## Edge banding

To put on some wood feelings, and also used as separator for the cubes, I got some walnut heat on banding and just applied them afterwards.

## Lesson learned

I am pretty glad the bookcase turns out look great and I am proud of it.

If I would do it again, I would probably change the design a bit to make it vertically mirrored - like in the build plan v2, that would give me the flexibility to rotate the cubes to choose which side to facing outside. Also, having one full board on each layer would make the whole case stronger.
