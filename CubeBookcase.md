# Cube Bookcase

## Overview

[Last Update: 6/4/2020]

This project is in progress. Got [the 3D model](https://a360.co/35g3FB4) drafted. Here's the render:

I plan to use 1/2" sande plywood to build it.

## Start

After I have the build plan above, I went to the store, bought 2 4' by 8' plywood. I ripped them into 4 1' by 8' each and took them home.

At this point, I am expecting a lot of cross cuts. It is probably worth the time to build a crosscut sled:

After an hour, here's all the boards in their width, 13", 12.5", 12" and 11.5", and a 24" board for the base.

To build the boxes, I start to cut the rabbet like on the plan:

Okay, ready to do some real job:

And here's the base, simply guy 3 pieces of plywood together:

Then, I start to build up the stack of cases. They have been separated to layers, each layer looks like this except the top layer, and I built 3 of these:

Basically, the vertical boards in middle of the cases are 13" in length. They are glued together with 1" up-down to form the insert at the top and the bottom.

On top of each case, I use board in length of 11.5" and 12" interactively to form a groove for the insert above this layer.

And the top layer is even more simple:

The build out looked like this - only without paint:

It has shorter vertical boards in the middle, and it doesn't need to form another groove for anything on the top.

To be continue ...
