# Woodwork bench - Design

It has been a while I wanted a bench. After finish building [the bookcase](./CubeBookcase.md), I start to spend time design it.

## Goal

I am going to build a solid workbench for under $100.

## Design

There are several considerations that I have in my mind before I start:

* The bench doesn't have to do everything, but it should be really great when I want some hand work done on it.
  * I have already had a work surface, that's [the table saw bench](./TableSawBench.md) I built.

* I want the bench to be heavy & stable - it should handle force side to side well.

* No vise to begin with - I will consider add it later - when the real needs come.
  * On the other hand, I will try to address all sorts of wood working tasks, there should at least be one way to deal with surface, edge and ends, without a vise.

* Be small. I don't have a giant shop, I don't want the bench to take too much space.

### Draft

The first draft comes in with an apron on each side. It features 54" in length, 16.5" in width and 24" tall:

The most of it will be built out of 2 by 4 like the table top, the legs and the stretchers. The apron will be 2 x 10, maybe.

And then, it becomes:

And then:

And then:

Okay, in summary, here are some of the tweaks and why:

### Height

* 24" is too low even for a short person like me. It is increased to 29" tall.

### Aprons or Apron

* In my case, apron on single side seems more flexible:
  * I don't see myself working on two big piece at one time.
  * It leaves the possibilities to easy clamp on the other side.
  * I want to try and see which side works better for me.
* On the other hand, the apron's put below the table top so that I will gain a little bit more vertical surface.

### Mortises

* To get back the stability the notches on the apron would provide, I add two mortises instead.
