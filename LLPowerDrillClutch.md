# [Lesson Learnt] Set proper clutch for the power drill

// TODO: Image for the drill

## What I have learned

* Properly setting up the clutch on my power drill
* Stop timing the stopping point, let the drill decide

## The issue

More expensive or cheaper, my drill bits wore out really quick. When I drill, it is easy for the drill to slip out of the screws although I pushed hard, and I have tried my best to timing the stop, it almost feels like the drill is just too powerful. That broke the screw head as well as the drill bits.

As a matter of fact,

  1. There's a clutch settings on my drill, and
  1. It had always been set to maximum.

And that is the problem.

## Setup the clutch

Here's how the clutch settings looks like:

For my bosch drill, I have marks from 1 (minimum torque) to 20, and then all the way to a drill sign (maximum). They are used to set for various torque before the drill stops twisting when drilling.

For the drilling the screws, I starts from smaller settings, like 10ish (surprisingly, 10 works well for most of the cases). And instead of timing the stop, I just **keep drilling until I heard the drill stops twisting**. The sounds different and easy to recognize.

_Tips: Sometimes, lower settings will work for drilling holes as well. It doesn't always require adjustment._

Ever since then, the screws stop is better; the drill bits stops at the right torque and barely jumped out; and I find it easier to work with screws.
