## What I have learned

* Properly setting up the clutch on my power drill
* Do **NOT** try to time the stopping point, let the drill do

## The issue

Expensive or cheap, my drill bits wore out really quick. When I drill, it is easy for the bits to slip out of the screw heads although I pushed hard, and I have tried my best to time the stop. It almost feels like the drill is just too powerful.

That broke the screw head as well as the drill bits.

As a matter of fact,

  1. There's a clutch settings on my drill, and
  1. It had always been set to maximum.

And properly set the clutch will resolve the problem.

## Setup the clutch

Here's how the clutch settings looks like:

For my bosch drill, I have marks from 1 (minimum torque) to 20, and then all the way to a drill bit sign (maximum). They are used to set for various torque before the drill stops twisting.

To drill the screws, I start from a small number, like 10 (surprisingly, 10 works well for most of the cases), increase it if the screw doesn't go all in.

And instead of timing the stop, I just **keep drilling until the clutch disengage**.

_Tips: Sometimes, lower settings will work for drilling holes as well. It doesn't always require adjustment between drilling screws and holes._

Ever since then, the screws stop at the correct depth; the drill bits barely jump out; and I find it easier to work with screws.
